## Plan

Note: 

- [ ] is holding
- [/] is doing
- [X] is done

---

[X] Review monorepo structure and dependency management for potential conflicts between Web and Mini Program platforms

[X] Analyze TypeScript shared logic implementation for platform-specific compatibility issues

[X] Examine React+TDesign Web implementation against Mini Program framework constraints

[X] Validate chord transposition algorithm consistency across platforms

[X] Check data models and interfaces for cross-platform compatibility

[X] Review build configuration and deployment pipeline for both platforms

[X] Assess component reusability and platform-specific adaptations

[X] Verify API integration patterns and data synchronization mechanisms

[X] Examine error handling and user feedback consistency across platforms

[X] Review performance optimization strategies for each platform
