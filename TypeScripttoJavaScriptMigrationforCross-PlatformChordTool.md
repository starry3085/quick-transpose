# TypeScript to JavaScript Migration for Cross-Platform Chord Tool

## Core Features

- TypeScript to JavaScript conversion for shared/src/web only

- Build system simplification

- Cross-platform compatibility maintenance

- Code quality preservation

- Documentation updates

## Tech Stack

{
  "Web": {
    "arch": "react",
    "component": "shadcn"
  },
  "Build": "Vite with JavaScript configuration",
  "MiniProgram": "Already JavaScript - no changes needed",
  "Shared": "Pure JavaScript modules"
}

## Design

Maintain existing UI/UX design while simplifying technical stack, preserve component architecture and responsive layouts

## Plan
