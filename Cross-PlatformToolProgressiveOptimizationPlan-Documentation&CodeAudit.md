# Cross-Platform Tool Progressive Optimization Plan - Documentation & Code Audit

## Core Features

- Create project-wide Documentation Map

- Create Code Structure Map across packages (web, src, shared, miniprogram, scripts)

- Identify duplication between src/ and web/ apps

- Define clear package boundaries and ownership

- List risks and coupling hotspots

- Output non-destructive consolidation options

- Prioritize actions, no code changes in this phase

## Tech Stack

{
  "Web": {
    "arch": "react",
    "component": "shadcn"
  },
  "Monorepo": "Current structure with TypeScript build system",
  "Mini Program": "Native WeChat Mini Program (already compliant)"
}

## Design

Non-destructive audit with structured deliverables: Doc Map, Code Map, Issue List, Action Plan
