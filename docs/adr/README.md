# Architecture Decision Records (ADR)

This directory contains Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) for the Quick Transpose project. ADRs document important architectural decisions, their context, and rationale.

## What are ADRs?

Architecture Decision Records are short text documents that capture an important architectural decision made along with its context and consequences. They help teams understand why certain decisions were made and provide historical context for future changes.

## ADR Format

Each ADR follows a consistent format:

1. **Title**: Brief description of the decision
2. **Status**: Proposed, Accepted, Deprecated, or Superseded
3. **Context**: The situation that led to this decision
4. **Decision**: What was decided
5. **Consequences**: The positive and negative outcomes

## ADR Index

| ADR | Title | Status | Date |
|-----|-------|--------|------|
| [ADR-0001](0001-multi-platform-architecture.md) | Multi-Platform Architecture Strategy | Accepted | 2025-01-08 |
| [ADR-0002](0002-shared-core-design.md) | Shared Core Module Design | Accepted | 2025-01-08 |
| [ADR-0003](0003-platform-specific-implementations.md) | Platform-Specific Implementation Strategy | Accepted | 2025-01-08 |
| [ADR-0004](0004-documentation-automation.md) | Automated Documentation Generation | Accepted | 2025-01-08 |

## Creating New ADRs

To create a new ADR:

1. Copy the [ADR template](template.md)
2. Number it sequentially (e.g., `0005-your-decision.md`)
3. Fill in all sections
4. Update this README index
5. Submit for review

## ADR Lifecycle

- **Proposed**: Decision is under consideration
- **Accepted**: Decision has been approved and implemented
- **Deprecated**: Decision is no longer recommended but may still be in use
- **Superseded**: Decision has been replaced by a newer ADR
