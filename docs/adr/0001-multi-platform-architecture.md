# ADR-0001: Multi-Platform Architecture Strategy

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The Quick Transpose project needs to serve multiple user groups across different platforms:
- Desktop users requiring offline functionality and system integration
- Web users needing convenient online access and cross-device synchronization
- Mobile users in the WeChat ecosystem wanting lightweight, fast access

Initial analysis suggested this might be "code duplication," but deeper investigation revealed distinct platform requirements and user needs. The team needed to decide between:
1. Single codebase with platform abstraction layers
2. Separate platform implementations with shared core logic
3. Completely independent platform applications

## Decision

We will implement a **multi-platform architecture** with platform-specific implementations sharing a common core module:

```
quick-transpose/
├── src/           # Desktop Application (Electron)
├── web/           # Web Application (React)
├── miniprogram/   # WeChat Mini Program
└── shared/        # Cross-platform core logic
```

Each platform maintains its own:
- User interface implementation
- Platform-specific optimizations
- Build and deployment processes
- Dependency management

All platforms share:
- Business logic (chord transposition algorithms)
- Data models and types
- Core utilities and helpers

## Consequences

### Positive
- **Platform Optimization**: Each platform can be optimized for its specific environment and constraints
- **Independent Deployment**: Platforms can be deployed and versioned independently
- **User Experience**: Tailored user experiences that feel native to each platform
- **Team Scalability**: Different teams can work on different platforms without conflicts
- **Risk Mitigation**: Issues in one platform don't affect others
- **Technology Flexibility**: Each platform can use the most appropriate technology stack

### Negative
- **Maintenance Overhead**: Multiple codebases require more maintenance effort
- **Code Duplication**: Some UI logic and patterns may be duplicated across platforms
- **Complexity**: Build and deployment processes are more complex
- **Documentation Burden**: Each platform needs its own documentation and guides
- **Testing Overhead**: Requires testing across multiple platforms and environments

### Neutral
- **Learning Curve**: Developers need to understand multiple platform technologies
- **Resource Allocation**: Requires careful planning of development resources across platforms

## Implementation Notes

1. **Shared Module First**: All new business logic should be implemented in the shared module
2. **Platform Adapters**: Each platform implements adapter interfaces defined in shared module
3. **Version Synchronization**: Shared module versions should be synchronized across platforms
4. **Testing Strategy**: Core logic tested in shared module, platform-specific features tested individually
5. **Documentation**: Each platform maintains its own setup and deployment documentation
