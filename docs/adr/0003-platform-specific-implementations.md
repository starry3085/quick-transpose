# ADR-0003: Platform-Specific Implementation Strategy

## Status

Accepted

## Context

Following the multi-platform architecture (ADR-0001) and shared core design (ADR-0002) decisions, we need to define how each platform will implement its specific features while maintaining consistency and code quality.

Each platform has unique characteristics:
- **Desktop (Electron)**: File system access, native OS integration, offline-first
- **Web (React)**: Browser APIs, responsive design, progressive web app features
- **WeChat Mini Program**: WeChat APIs, 2MB package limit, custom component system

We need to balance platform optimization with development efficiency and maintenance overhead.

## Decision

We will implement **platform-specific optimization** while maintaining **architectural consistency**:

### Desktop Implementation (`src/`)
- **Technology**: Electron + React + TypeScript
- **Architecture**: Main process + Renderer process
- **Storage**: File system with encrypted local storage
- **UI**: Native-feeling desktop interface
- **Distribution**: Native installers for Windows, macOS, Linux

### Web Implementation (`web/`)
- **Technology**: React + TypeScript + Vite
- **Architecture**: Single-page application with service worker
- **Storage**: IndexedDB with localStorage fallback
- **UI**: Responsive design with mobile-first approach
- **Distribution**: Static files deployed to CDN

### Mini Program Implementation (`miniprogram/`)
- **Technology**: WeChat Mini Program framework
- **Architecture**: Page-based with custom components
- **Storage**: WeChat storage APIs
- **UI**: WeChat design guidelines compliance
- **Distribution**: WeChat Mini Program store

## Consequences

### Positive
- **Optimal User Experience**: Each platform provides the best possible user experience for its environment
- **Platform Features**: Full utilization of platform-specific capabilities
- **Performance**: Optimized for each platform's constraints and capabilities
- **Native Feel**: Applications feel native to their respective platforms
- **Independent Evolution**: Platforms can evolve independently based on user feedback

### Negative
- **Development Complexity**: Requires expertise in multiple technologies
- **Testing Overhead**: Each platform needs comprehensive testing
- **Feature Parity**: Maintaining feature consistency across platforms requires coordination
- **Resource Requirements**: More development and maintenance resources needed

### Neutral
- **Technology Diversity**: Team needs to maintain expertise across multiple tech stacks
- **Deployment Complexity**: Multiple deployment pipelines and processes

## Implementation Notes

### Shared Responsibilities
- All platforms must implement the `PlatformAdapter` interface
- Core business logic must remain in the shared module
- Consistent error handling and logging across platforms
- Unified testing approach for shared functionality

### Platform-Specific Guidelines

#### Desktop (`src/`)
```typescript
class DesktopAdapter implements PlatformAdapter {
  storage = new ElectronStorage();
  ui = new ElectronUI();
  audio = new ElectronAudio();
}
```

#### Web (`web/`)
```typescript
class WebAdapter implements PlatformAdapter {
  storage = new WebStorage();
  ui = new WebUI();
  audio = new WebAudio();
}
```

#### Mini Program (`miniprogram/`)
```javascript
class MiniprogramAdapter {
  storage = new WechatStorage();
  ui = new WechatUI();
  // Audio not supported in mini programs
}
```

### Quality Standards
- TypeScript for type safety (where supported)
- Comprehensive unit and integration testing
- Consistent code formatting and linting
- Performance monitoring and optimization
- Accessibility compliance (web and desktop)
