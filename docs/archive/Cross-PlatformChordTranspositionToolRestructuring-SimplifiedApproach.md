# Cross-Platform Chord Transposition Tool Restructuring - Simplified Approach

## Core Features

- Single Repository Structure

- Shared TypeScript Utilities

- WeChat Mini Program Compliance

- Multi-Platform Build System

- Cross-Platform Code Sharing

- Automated Build Tools

- Consolidated Documentation

## Tech Stack

{
  "Web": {
    "arch": "react",
    "component": null
  },
  "Shared": "TypeScript utilities with platform adapters",
  "WeChat": "WeChat Mini Program Framework + compiled shared code",
  "Build": "Vite for web + custom build scripts for miniprogram"
}

## Design

Single repository with shared/ directory for common utilities, web/ for React app, and miniprogram/ for WeChat Mini Program. Build system compiles shared TypeScript code for both platforms without monorepo complexity.

## Plan

Note: 

- [ ] is holding
- [/] is doing
- [X] is done
