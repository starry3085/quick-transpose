# Cross-Platform Tool Refactoring Plan

## Core Features

- Unified Monorepo Architecture

- WeChat Mini Program Compliance

- Centralized Shared Logic

- Standardized Tooling & Documentation

## Tech Stack

{
  "Monorepo": "TypeScript with NPM/Yarn/PNPM Workspaces",
  "Web": {
    "arch": "react",
    "bundler": "Vite"
  },
  "Mini Program": "Native WeChat Mini Program"
}

## Design

A clean monorepo code architecture that separates shared logic from platform-specific implementations (Web/Mini Program), eliminating redundancy and aligning with WeChat's official development standards.
