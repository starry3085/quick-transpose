- package.json, platforms/miniprogram/package.json (dependency alignment)
- platforms/miniprogram/utils/constants.js (complete CHORD_MAPS)
- platforms/miniprogram/utils/storage.js (CrossPlatformStorage implementation)
- platforms/web/src/utils/shared-import.ts (import path optimization)

### 4. Push to GitHub main branch
```bash
git push origin main
```

### 5. Push to Gitee main branch
```bash
git push gitee main
```

## Alternative: Push to both remotes at once
If you have both remotes configured, you can push to both simultaneously:

```bash
# Add both remotes if not already added
git remote add origin https://github.com/your-username/quick-transpose.git
git remote add gitee https://gitee.com/your-username/quick-transpose.git

# Push to both
git push origin main && git push gitee main
```

## Verification Commands:
```bash
# Check remote repositories
git remote -v

# Verify the push was successful
git log --oneline -5
```

## Notes:
- Make sure you're on the main branch: `git checkout main`
- If you encounter conflicts, resolve them before pushing
- Ensure you have proper authentication set up for both GitHub and Gitee
